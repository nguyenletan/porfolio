### About the Project
“GadgetCMS” is a content management system that can provide & manage content related to electronic products. It provides users the ability to read a review & specifications of a gadget. Users who create an account on the website are given an ability to post their own opinion about a product and rate it. 

Users  given the  role of “Editor” will be able to create content about a gadget  and post a review on them. Further, users with role of “Moderator” and “Admin” will have the ability to manage the administrative capabilities of the site.

### Features
My aim is to build a server-side Content Management system specifically tailored to managing content related to Electronic products such as smartphones, smart-watches, etc. It is built upon the modern ASP.NET Core framework based on Razor page model. The system is called “GadgetCMS” which falls under “Web Content Management (WCM)” system.
