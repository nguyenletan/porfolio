### About the project

- Social housing providers are tackling a myriad of policy, financial and user-demanded changes. A changing population adds to the pressure as providers must understand their customers and provide them with appropriate services.

- Cx Housing is the digital platform for social housing connects your customer and property data to create a single version of the truth. It allows to manage the customers' differing needs and the property they live in.

- Cx Housing helps to manage these challenges by putting the customers and tenants at the heart of service delivery. An integrated customer relationship management and communication module helps to manage all your customer interactions in one place, including customers' preferred language and communication channels. It's simple to segment the customers into groups based on their needs, so that you can proactively engage with them.

- Cx Housing helps to manage the property assets. You can create a hierarchy of assets to reflect the needs of your organisation and the complexity of the mix - from different tenure types and occupation periods, to schemes, blocks and estate management, as well as multi company relationships.

- CX Housing also provide a built-in portal allows customers to access services at a time convenient to them.
