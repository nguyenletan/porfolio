## GitHub Repository
- [BloodDonation](https://github.com/Amorpheuz/BloodDonation)

### Aim of the Project
- People in need of blood and those organizing blood camps will be able to find users that are most likely to donate. 
- The system will find these users using ML technologies and then send them notification making them aware about possible chance of donating blood. 
- It will also provide the organizations that partner with the App to share information and allow these organizations to maintain contact with their regular donors. 

### Workflow

- Donor
    - User registers on App via one of the multiple ways to sign in. 
    - User fills in his personal information which include various details like blood group, medical history, location and donation history. 
    - The Machine Learning algorithm in the back then analyzes the information and assigns various parameters on the likeliness of that user to donate, to his/her data. 

- Requester
    - When a person/camp organizer needs donors, they will put out an alert via the app, wherein they will provide information such as location of camp/person, duration within which the request should be fulfilled, and the type of blood needed (if required). 
    - A script will read through this data of users and then send targeted notifications to those who are most likely to donate for that alert. 
    - These users will then get a notification on their devices about the alert, which in turn will allow them to accept attending the alert or mark as unable to attend. 

- Extras
    - Users can earn a form of virtual currency for performing various actions for the app, such as sharing an alert on social media, getting users registered to the app via a referral link, etc. 
    - This virtual currency will allow the app to have high user retention by providing a way for the app to engage users. 
    - The app will also be partnered with various charities/organizations fighting for cause related to blood and provide them a direct way to donate to these charities/organizations.
