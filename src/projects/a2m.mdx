### About

The A2Milk Company was founded in New Zealand in 2000 by scientist Dr Corrie McLachlan and his business partner Howard Paterson on the knowledge that not all milk is the same.
Since then, we have worked alongside scientists from around the world to pioneer the scientific understanding of unique benefits of the A2 protein type.
To this day our purpose remains the same, to enrich people’s lives through the wonder of nature – through the naturally occurring a2 Milk™ difference.

In 2020, A2Milk revamped its website to give it a new, professional, and modern look. They also wanted to improve its speed by using NextJS - an open-source web development framework built on top of Node.js enabling React-based web applications functionalities such as server-side rendering and generating static websites.
