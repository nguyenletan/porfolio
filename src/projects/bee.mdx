### About

BEE acts as a dedicated Business Intelligence (BI) software that provides visibility to client organisations on electrical energy performance estimates from their facility's (building's) electrical consumption.

For an accurate prediction of metered building energy usage in the electrical energy consumption at the system and sub-system level.  To develop energy savings has two key elements:

- Forecasting future energy usage without improvements.

- Forecasting energy use after a specific set of improvements have been implemented.

The 'BEE' web-based application is used to fix these problems and with the busy 'prosumers' such as  Facility, Building and Property Manager and property management companies in mind and help to reduce this huge energy consumption within buildings today.

We use Postgres database, ReactJs and Recoil for front-end side, NestJs + Prisma Js for  API back-end side.
